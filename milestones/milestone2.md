## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to design database quickly with the help of CodePath materials.

We had some difficulties with designing wireframes. All of us don't have much exposure with Figma.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need help with finalizing our design (colors, animations, elements) and decide which features to implement.
